## Default Sample Model

I recommend using the **"Parthenon Fragment"** or similar classical architecture piece as your default model because:

1. ‚úÖ Medium complexity (good for testing)
2. ‚úÖ Clear geometric faces (perfect for face coloring feature)
3. ‚úÖ Cultural significance
4. ‚úÖ Good size (not too large)
5. ‚úÖ Works well with explosion feature

### Alternative Default Models

If you need a simple built-in default, here are good options:

**Option 1: Greek Column Capital**
- Geometric and regular
- Clear faces for coloring
- Cultural significance
- Good for demonstration

**Option 2: Simple Pottery Vessel**
- Smooth curves
- Easy to view
- Universal cultural item
- Good size

**Option 3: Architectural Ornament**
- Detailed but not overwhelming
- Clear structure
- Educational value

## Technical Requirements for Models

### ‚úÖ Supported Formats
- **OBJ** - Best for this project (widely supported, includes materials)
- **PLY** - Good for scanned objects
- **STL** - Simple geometry
- **GLB/GLTF** - Modern format with textures

### üìè Recommended Specifications

**File Size:**
- Small: 1-5 MB (quick loading)
- Medium: 5-20 MB (good detail)
- Large: 20-100 MB (high detail, slower)

**Triangle Count:**
- Low poly: 1,000-10,000 triangles (fast)
- Medium poly: 10,000-100,000 triangles (balanced)
- High poly: 100,000+ triangles (detailed, slower)

**For Best Performance:**
- **Recommended:** 5,000-50,000 triangles
- **File size:** 2-15 MB
- **Format:** OBJ or GLB

## Need Help?

If models aren't loading:
1. Check file format (OBJ, PLY, STL, GLB)
2. Verify file size (< 100 MB)
3. Ensure file isn't corrupted
4. Try a different model
5. Check backend console for errors

For thesis documentation:
- Screenshot the models in your viewer
- Note the source and license
- Explain why you chose each model
- Show different features with different models
